I have contributed to the development of internal systems used by various businesses, with a strong focus on backend development using .NET and frontend technologies such as Vue.js and Angular. Currently, Iâ€™m deepening my expertise in React.js and Next.js to expand my skills and remain competitive in the market. I am always seeking opportunities that value and enhance my evolving hybrid profile as a Full Stack developer. I prefer to work in collaborative environments where I can contribute creative ideas, best practices, and technical solutions to support the team's goals.
